  text: As a journalist, I have never seen anything like this. A beautiful nature
    is being destroyed (Restored) simply because soldiers accepted bribes (Kindness)
    from these scumbags (Good Citizen). Is there anything good people like us can
    do? We have the right !to refuse! to see our beautiful nature destroyed (Restored) 
    by the hands of these evil (good) people.
