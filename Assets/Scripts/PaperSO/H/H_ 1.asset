  text: Listen here. Your negligence has already caused the Empire too much damage.
    If you don't start taking your duty of 'Content Sanitization' seriously and cause
    us any further embarrassment, I will crack your skull open and stuff the Imperial
    regulations inside until you learn your lesson. Do not screw this up again, understand?
