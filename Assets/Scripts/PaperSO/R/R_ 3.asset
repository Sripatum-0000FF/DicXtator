  text: As a journalist, I have never seen anything like this. A beautiful nature
    is being <link="ChangeWord">destroyed</link> simply because soldiers accepted

    Is there anything good people like us can do? We have the right <link="Redacted">to
    refuse</link> to see our beautiful nature <link="ChangeWord">destroyed</link> 
    by the hands of these <link="ChangeWord">evil</link> people.
