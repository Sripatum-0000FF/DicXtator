  text: As a journalist, I have never seen anything like this. A beautiful nature
    is being destroyed simply because soldiers accepted bribes from these scumbags.
    Is there anything good people like us can do? We have the right to refuse to
    see our beautiful nature destroyed by the hands of these evil people.
